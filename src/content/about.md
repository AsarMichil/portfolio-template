# About Me

I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at UBC in the co-op program, originally from Toronto but now loving life in Vancouver. I'm passionate about building software that feels genuinely nice to use - whether that's a smooth web interface or robust backend systems that just work.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me biking around the city (Vancouver's bike lanes are incredible), exploring new coffee shops, or diving into music of all kinds. I'm constantly amazed by how diverse Toronto and Vancouver's music scenes are, from underground electronic to indie rock to everything in between.

I'm deeply optimistic about Canada's potential in tech. Having worked at startups and seen how much impact small teams can have, I believe we have everything it takes to compete globally. I love that Canadian companies are building world-class products while maintaining the collaborative, thoughtful culture that makes this country special.

Currently, I'm fascinated by the intersection of systems design and user experience - how do you build something that scales to millions of users while still feeling personal and responsive? That's the kind of problem I want to spend my career solving.
